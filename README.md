Tested with Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 4GB RAM with Raspbian. (I don't know the version. It came with a kit but I updated it.) Samples each sensor at about 985Hz when using four bands. Sampling at 2kHz with latest update on a Raspberry Pi 4.

Interfaced with Adafruit's ItsyBitsy M0 Express 48MHz using a virtual serial port over USB.
