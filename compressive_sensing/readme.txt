Run everything:
- run_everything.m

Visualization Instructions:

Run the commands in MATLAB

To visualize raw and cleaned data:
- run_data_cleaning.m

To visualize SVD components:
- run_sensor_data_SVD_vis.m
- run_display_SVD_vis.m

To visualize time sources:

- run_select_top_sources_vis.m
- run_display_top_time_sources_vis.m

To view the animation (must run the commands to visualize time sources first)
- run_display_sources_vis.m

Notes:
(0) CVXOPT needs to be installed to successfully run the program.

(1) run_everything executes reading raw data to generating the time sources. Variables names are multi_time_sourceX, multi_time_sourceY, multi_time_sourceZ
(2) Users may change the codes to view the targeted dimension of accelerations
